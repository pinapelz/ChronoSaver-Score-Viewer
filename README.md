# CHRONO-SAVER SCORE VIEWER
A scraped version of Chrono Circle's MYPAGE "Play Stats" view. Allows you to import a score file (JSON) generated by [ChronoSaver](https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Hay1tsme/ChronoSaver/src/branch/master) or other compatible tools

[Chrono Circle will go offline January 31st 2025](https://chrono-circle.com/bbs/board.php?bo_table=notice&wr_id=77), the MYPAGE service will still be available for some time even after, so you may want to save your scores by using a tool like ChronoSaver before then.
